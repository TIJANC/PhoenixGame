The complexity of environmental issues often hinders our ability
to comprehend their relationship with human activities.
The “Collective Ecosystem Game” is a board game designed for
up to 18 people that aims to tackle this issue by fostering social
learning about the relationship between environmental processes
and territorial transformations. First, players choose one of three
diverse development scenarios, forming the teams accordingly.
Second, they make decisions about the future transformations of
an ideal territory. The game leverages the concept of “Nature’s
Contributions to People” (e.g., food, energy, climate regulation,
etc.) and assumes that the territory’s ability to provide such
contributions depends on land use patterns. It considers the
variations of Nature’s Contributions to People in the urban and
peri-urban areas in a radius of approximately 30 km (more details
in the actions’ descriptions). In each round, teams choose the
strategies and interventions they want to implement by selecting
one card from a small deck, actively transforming the territory’s
land use and influencing its capacity to provide “Nature’s
Contributions to People”. The team that most effectively enhances
the territory’s ability to support human societies wins.
